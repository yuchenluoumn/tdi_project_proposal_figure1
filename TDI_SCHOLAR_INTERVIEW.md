## __2. MOTIVATION AND GOAL__

<font size=5>i) a helper in university application process</font>
<br>
<br>
<font size=5>ii) a database to go to during job hunting</font>
<br>
<br>
<font size=5>iii) a predictor for H1B application result</font>

## __4. H1B APPLICATION PER STATE : ACADEMIA VS INDUSTRY__

<font size=5>Texas universities/colleges have filed the most number of H1B application. And California has the most industry job opportunities for foreigh works.</font>

## __5. CS VS NON-CS JOBS H1B APPLICATION FROM 2011-2018__

<font size=5>CS related jobs increases faster than the nonCS jobs and the rate of increase for all jobs seems to slow down at 2015.</font>

## __6. IMBALANCED DATA CLASSIFICATION__

<font size=5>The application results are very imbalanced and need resampling techniques to deal with. I have used SMOTE techniques,Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique, to make all classes equally distributed which can be used for further machine learning techniques.</font>
